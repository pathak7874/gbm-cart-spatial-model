**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
A clear description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm frustrated when [...]

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Biological/clinical justification**

- Why is this mechanism important?
- What literature supports it?
- How would it improve predictions?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Other approaches you've thought about.

**Implementation suggestion**
If you have ideas on how to implement:
```python
# Pseudocode or outline
```

**Clinical use case**
How would this help patient care or clinical trials?

**Priority**
