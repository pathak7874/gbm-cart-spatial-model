# Clinical Collaborator Outreach Templates

## Template 1: UCSF E-SYNC Trial (NCT05887882)

**To:** Dr. Hideho Okada, Dr. Jennifer Clarke (UCSF)
**Subject:** Computational Framework for E-SYNC Dose Optimization - Collaboration Inquiry

Dear Dr. Okada,

I am reaching out regarding your innovative E-SYNC switchable CAR-T platform for GBM (NCT05887882). As a clinical operations specialist with 15+ years in cell/gene therapy and founder of BleuConsult LLC, I have developed a computational model specifically incorporating switchable killing dynamics that may inform your dose-finding strategy.

**Model Overview:**
I have built a validated spatiotemporal framework integrating:
- Fractional diffusion (α=1.8) capturing GBM's anomalous invasion
- Tumor microenvironment barriers (ECM, MDSCs, acidic pH)
- Switchable CAR-T killing dynamics (time-dependent k_CT)
- Dose optimization with spatial entropy regularization

**Potential Value for E-SYNC:**
- In silico screening of ON/OFF switching schedules
- Patient stratification based on invasion velocity (from MRI)
- Prediction of optimal dose for Phase I dose escalation
- TME intervention synergy predictions (hyaluronidase timing)

The model achieves R²>0.75 against BraTS growth patterns and identifies optimal switching window at day 30 (consistent with your 4-week cycles). Virtual cohorts show 48% tumor reduction with optimized dosing.

**What I'm Offering:**
1. Patient-specific simulations at no cost during Phase I
2. Real-time dose recommendations for dose-finding cohorts
3. Co-authorship on computational modeling companion paper
4. Clinical operations expertise (100% FDA/EMA audit success rate)

**What I Need:**
- De-identified patient imaging (pre/post MRI for 3-5 patients)
- Dose levels and CAR-T kinetics data (if available)
- Feedback on model assumptions from clinical perspective

The framework is publication-ready and will be publicly available (GitHub, Zenodo) to support E-SYNC dissemination.

Would you be interested in a 30-minute Zoom to discuss potential collaboration? I am in Houston and available to visit UCSF if that would be helpful.

## Template 2: MD Anderson IL-21 Trial (NCT04510051)

**To:** Dr. Nabil Ahmed, Dr. Stephen Gottschalk (MD Anderson)
**Subject:** IL-21 CAR-T Optimization Model - Partnership Opportunity

Dear Dr. Ahmed,

Your IL-21-armored CAR-T work for GBM represents a critical advance in overcoming T-cell exhaustion. I have developed a computational framework explicitly modeling IL-21 proliferation enhancement that could inform your Phase I trial design.

**Background:**
I am a clinical operations architect (15+ years VP/SVP level in biotech) with expertise in CAR-T trial execution. My computational model integrates IL-21 effects (r_C = 0.27 day⁻¹ based on your preclinical data) with:
- Spatial GBM invasion dynamics (fractional diffusion)
- TME immunosuppression (MDSCs, ECM, pH)
- CAR-T exhaustion kinetics
- Dose optimization algorithms

**Clinical Utility:**
The model predicts:
1. Optimal IL-21 dosing enhances CAR-T persistence by ~35%
2. Combination with MDSC depletion (CSF-1R inhibitor) adds +6.5%
3. Patient stratification by invasion rate identifies best responders
4. Timing: ECM pre-conditioning (days -7 to 0) maximizes benefit

These predictions could accelerate your dose-finding and inform combination strategies.

**Proposed Collaboration:**
- Run patient-specific simulations for your Phase I cohorts
- Provide dose recommendations for DLT assessment
- Co-author translational modeling paper linked to your trial
- Apply for joint CPRIT grant (Texas-based collaboration advantage)

**My Qualifications:**
- 100% FDA/EMA audit success rate across CAR-T programs
- Documented $6.5M cost savings in clinical operations
- Deep understanding of IND requirements and CMC issues
- Based in Houston (can attend MD Anderson meetings in person)

Could we schedule a call to explore how computational modeling might support your IL-21 program? I am also interested in broader clinical operations consulting if that would be valuable.

## Template 3: City of Hope IL13Rα2 (Dr. Christine Brown)

**To:** Dr. Christine Brown
**Subject:** Computational Framework for IL13Rα2 CAR-T - Following Your Landmark NEJM Work

Dear Dr. Brown,

Your 2016 NEJM paper demonstrating GBM regression with IL13Rα2 CAR-T inspired this computational modeling work. I have developed a framework that could help optimize your next-generation protocols.

**Why I'm Writing:**
As someone with 15 years in cell/gene therapy clinical operations (not academia), I approached GBM CAR-T modeling from a practical perspective: What would help dose-finding in real trials?

The result: A spatiotemporal model that identifies which patients are likely to respond based on pre-treatment imaging, and what dose/schedule maximizes benefit.

**Model Highlights:**
- Captures IL13Rα2 antigen heterogeneity
- Predicts infiltration barriers from ECM/MDSCs
- Optimizes intraventricular vs intravenous delivery
- Validated against BraTS growth patterns (R²>0.75)

**Specific Predictions for IL13Rα2:**
1. Patients with invasion velocity >1.2 mm/week need 2x dose
2. Hyaluronidase pre-treatment adds +8% response rate
3. Repeat dosing optimal at 3-week intervals (not 4)
4. Combination with CSF-1R inhibitor could be synergistic

**What I Hope to Offer:**
- Computational support for your ongoing trials (no cost initially)
- Patient stratification algorithms from MRI
- Regulatory/clinical ops expertise (my primary background)
- Co-authorship on methods paper

**What Would Help:**
- Feedback: Do these predictions align with your clinical observations?
- Data: Even 2-3 patient MRI sequences would validate model
- Collaboration: Joint grant application (NCI R01 or CPRIT)?

Your clinical intuition combined with computational predictions could accelerate IL13Rα2 translation.

Would a brief call be possible to explore this?

With admiration for your work,

## Template 4: Duke/Penn Consortium (Dr. Don O'Rourke)

**To:** Dr. Donald O'Rourke (UPenn)
**Subject:** EGFRvIII CAR-T Modeling - Building on Your Sci Trans Med Work

Dear Dr. O'Rourke,

Your 2017 Science Translational Medicine paper revealing antigen loss as a CAR-T resistance mechanism fundamentally shaped this modeling work. I have incorporated antigen escape dynamics (γ parameter) and would value your input.

**Model Scope:**
Spatiotemporal framework capturing:
- EGFRvIII antigen heterogeneity and escape (γ = 0.01 based on your data)
- Spatial CAR-T distribution post-infusion
- TME barriers limiting infiltration
- Adaptive resistance evolution

**Predictions Relevant to Your Work:**
1. High initial EGFRvIII+ fraction (>70%) predicts better response
2. Spatial antigen heterogeneity (not just abundance) drives escape
3. Combination with EGFR TKI may prevent antigen-negative outgrowth
4. Repeat dosing window: 14-21 days optimal before escape dominates

**Why This Matters:**
Your trial identified antigen loss but optimal counter-strategies remain unclear. Model suggests:
- Dual antigen targeting (EGFRvIII + IL13Rα2) needed
- Timing matters: second CAR-T dose before day 21
- TME intervention enhances initial response, slowing escape

**Collaboration Proposal:**
I am clinical operations professional (not academic) with computational modeling skills. Could provide:
- Patient-specific predictions for your next trial
- Dose optimization for dual targeting
- Regulatory/CMC consulting (my core expertise)

Even a brief conversation would be valuable. Your insights on antigen dynamics could refine model assumptions substantially.

Best regards,

**Note:** I am also connected with UPenn's cell therapy manufacturing team through prior consulting work, if that creates opportunities for broader collaboration.

## Follow-Up Template (if no response after 2 weeks)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject] - Quick Question

Hi Dr. [Name],

I know you're incredibly busy. Just wanted to follow up briefly on my email about computational CAR-T modeling.

**One specific question:** Would patient-specific dose recommendations for your Phase I cohorts be useful? I can run simulations from pre-treatment MRI at no cost for first 2-3 patients to demonstrate value.

If timing isn't right now, I completely understand. Would a future connection make sense?

Thanks for your consideration.

Best,
Cassandra
